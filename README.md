Hi I am a retired IT professional but during our time we are not called "IT" yet we are the dinosaur computer professionals.
I want to get back to my first love - programming. Now I obsereved that programming is easy but being easy is hard for me because in my time, it takes a lot of bones, flesh and blood to finish a program (compiled and running)!
